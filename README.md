## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./src//assets/images/desktop-design.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vitejs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) - Next Generation Frontend Tooling
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### Continued development

Later on, I want to learn how to work on more difficult landing pages and then level up on an e-commerce and learn how to manage the whole store part.

### Useful resources

- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - I train often and love using it in my various projects.
- [vitejs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) - A project without vitejs would be like having a car without an engine :)
